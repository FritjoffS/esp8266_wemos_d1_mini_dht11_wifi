# ESP8266 and DHT11 temp and humid reading

</div>

This is a project that uses a ESP8266 (in my case Wemos D1 Mini) and one DHT11.

It connects to wifi using hardcoded credentials.
Check your wifi's connected devices to find the esp IP address.

To access the esp webserver, print the IP address in your web browser.

Connections <br>
DHT 11 vcc to esp 3,3v <br>
DHT 11 gnd to esp gnd <br>
